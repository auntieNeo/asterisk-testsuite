      # First, station1 dials out on line1 as in the first scenario.
      #
      # Once station1 has joined the BLA_line1 conference, station2 dials out
      # on the same line. This time, the extension station2_line1 is used;

      # After station2 joins the BLA_line1 conference, all stations hang up and
      # the conference is ended.
