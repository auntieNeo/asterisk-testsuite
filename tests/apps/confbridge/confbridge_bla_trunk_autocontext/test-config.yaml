  scenarios:
    -
      # Scenario 1:
      # This scenario originates a call on line1. The context for line1 should
      # have been created by the autocontext option for the trunk.
      #
      # If the autocontext option is working, then the call should proceed as
      # the confbridge_bla_trunk tests. station1 will answer the call, a
      # conference will be created, and all parties will hang up in turn.
