    summary: 'Test of BLA autocontext features'
    description: |
        This tests the autocontext options as they apply to BLA trunks and
        stations.

      # Scenario 1:
      # This scenario originates a call to the station1 extension in the
      # bla_stations context.
      #
      # If the autocontext option is working, then the call should proceed as
      # any other simple BLA test. The line1_outbound context will answer the
      # call, a conference will be created, and all parties will hang up in
      # turn.
